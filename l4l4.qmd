## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```


Inside a new code block write the following code:

## Quarto is cool!

```{r,include=FALSE}
dotchart(mtcars$mpg,labels=row.names(mtcars),cex=.7,
          main="Gas Milage for Car Models", 
          xlab="Miles Per Gallon")  
```
